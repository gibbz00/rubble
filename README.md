# Rubble

Rubble is a Bluetooth® Low Energy compatible protocol stack for embedded Rust.

Currently, Rubble supports Nordic's nRF52-series of MCUs. However, it was
designed to be hardware-independent, so support crates for other MCU families
are always welcome.

**NOTE: None of this has passed the Bluetooth® Qualification Process, so it
must not be used in commercial products!**

## Usage
