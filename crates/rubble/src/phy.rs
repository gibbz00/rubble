//! BLE data is transmitted on 40 different RF channels numbered from 0 to 39 with ascending
//! frequencies. Channels 0, 12 and 39 are reserved for advertising, all others are used for data
//! transmission. BLE internally uses so-called "Channel Indices" which reorder the RF channels so
//! that indices 0..=36 refer to data channels and 37..=39 refer to the advertising channels
//! (presumably to simplify channel hopping). The Link-Layer is only interested in these channel
//! indices, so only those are implemented here.
